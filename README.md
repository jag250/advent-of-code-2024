# advent-of-code-2024

For practice, I wrapped my Advent of Code solutions in a small Python CLI. You can specify which part of the question to run with `aoc 1` and `aoc 2`, and it runs the parts for your current day. You can optionally add a third number to specify the day you want to run (i.e. `aoc 1 4` runs Day 4, Part 1)

I wrote a run-once script, `generate_files.py`, to generate the day{n}.py files.
